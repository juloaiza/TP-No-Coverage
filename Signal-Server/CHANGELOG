SIGNAL SERVER CHANGELOG 

3.11 - 25 Sept 2018
More LIDAR edge cases, tidying of many meridian hacks(!) and regression tested with different LIDAR resolutions and configurations eg. 1x2, 2x1..
Meridian issue fixed for 30m but deliberately broken for 2m due to previous crap hacks causing a headache. Can be fixed in DEM by re-processing LIDAR tiles to NOT span the meridian.

3.09 - 7 Feb 2018
Meridian LIDAR cropping fix
